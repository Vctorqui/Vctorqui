### 😀 More about me...  
<p>HEY! I'm Victor Quiñones, FrontEnd Developer with experience in creating innovative and attractive user interfaces. Throughout my career, I have worked on a variety of projects both freelance and in the corporate environment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>💻 2 years of experience as a Frontend developer.</li>
  <li>🌱 Constantly learning to keep up to date with the latest trends in frontend development. </li>
</ul>

<p>Besides coding, I love watching anime movies, playing video games, and playing soccer. One of my favorite teams is Barcelona, but the truth is that I started to like soccer because of watching Messi. As I mentioned, I love video games, and my favorite game of all time is Uncharted. Sic parvis magna—Greatness from small beginnings. I always strive to live by that phrase in my life🚀</p>
